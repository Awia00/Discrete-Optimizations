\section{Theoretical part}


\begin{math}
Pr[C'\text{ has } \frac{n}{2} \text{ elements and has cost } \leq \mathcal{O}\left(OPT\right)]\\
\\
Pr[C' \text{ does not cover at least } \frac{n}{2} \text{ elements}] \leq \frac{n}{2} \frac{1}{4n} \leq \frac{1}{8}\\
\\
Pr[C' \text{ does cover at least } \frac{n}{2} \text{ elements}] \geq \frac{7}{8}
\end{math}

\section{Implementation part}
The implemented approxzimation algorithms can be seen in \textit{SimpleRoundingApproximator.java}, \textit{RandomizedRoundingApproximator.java} and \textit{PrimalDualSchemaApproximator.java}. As the name implies we decided to solve 2.3 with the Primal Dual Schema presented in the text by Vazirani.
