\section{Theoretical part}
Unfortunately, we have not had any lectures on probabilities of random variables, and therefore, we do not have the know-how to give this proof.

\newpar If we gave a solution, it would seem that we know how to solve this kind of exercise, but it would merely be a coincidence, if it was correct.

\section{Implementation part}
The computation table for the algorithms ca be seen below. The $f$ values are $scpa3: 17$, $scpc3: 18$, $scpnrf1: 132$ and $scpnrg5: 41$.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}

All of the results provide solutions which are closer to optimal than the guaranteed $f-OPT$. For all the algorithms, the solutions to instance $scpnrf1$ is further away than any of the other instances. This corresponds nicely to the fact that $f$ value of the instance is much higher than the others. Generally there is a trend between ratio to optimality and the $f$ values, which while intuitively fitting is not guaranteed by the theory.

The implemented approximation algorithms can be seen in \textit{SimpleRoundingApproximator.java}, \textit{RandomizedRoundingApproximator.java} and \textit{PrimalDualSchemaApproximator.java}. As the name implies we decided to solve 2.3 with the Primal Dual Schema algorithm presented in the text by Vazirani.
