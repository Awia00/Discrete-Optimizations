# 2. LP - focus on getting first feasible basic solution
Linear programming

Infeasible first solution

Auxiliary:
- new formulation with x0
- swap out with least constraining (most negative constraint value)
- Solve. Find value for x0 and determine feasiblity.

Unbounded

Degeneracy
Blands rule.

TODO: maybe read proof for auxiliary.
