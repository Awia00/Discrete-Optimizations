# 9. Heuristics - focus on nature-inspired metaheuristics
Optimization
Heuristic finds a suboptimal solution: upper bounds for min

Meta heuristics are heuristacs which can be used across mulitple problems and work in the solution space.

Solution space:
    A solution has a value
    A solution has a neighbourhood

Genetic
    Population of solutions
    neighbourood is crossover an mutation
    Crossover example
        |13|24|5|
        |14|52|3|
        becomes
        |13|52|5|
        |14|24|3|
        problem with repeating
        replace with first occurence of repeating element in original
        |13|52|4| // 4
        |15|24|3| // 5

    Mutate by swapping two cities
    
Ant
    Neighbourhood is probability based on pheromones
    uniformly increase circle from original, shortest tour has most pheromes.
    Pheronomes is on edges.

Bee
    Neihgbourhood is probability based on dance
    scout={0,2,3,1,4}
    bee 1st: 0      to {(1-p)/4, p, (1-p)/4, (1-p)/4}
    bee 2nd: 1st    to {(1-p)/3, (1-p)/4, p, (1-p)/4}
    and so on
    Unless illegal move where 1/(1-iteration) is used

Particle
    Neighbourhood is affected by personal best and best for swarm.
