# 8. Heuristics - focus on local search methods and metaheuristics
Optimization
Heuristic finds a suboptimal solution: upper bounds for min

Meta heuristics are heuristacs which can be used across mulitple problems and work in the solution space.

Solution space:
    A solution has a value
    A solution has a neighbourhood

Hillclimbing
    Local optimum

Simulated annealing
    Temperature slowly decrease
    Delta: if delta is < 0 then a better solution
    else update with probability r < e^(-Delta/T)

Tabu
    How much to save.
    Moves

TSP:
    Nieghbourhood:
        2-opt
        3-opt can be made by 2 opt
        k-opt cannot be made by 2opt.
