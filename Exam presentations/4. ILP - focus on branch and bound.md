# 4. ILP - focus on branch and bound

Integer Linear programming
Geometric interpretation
NP-hard

LP Relaxation

Lower bounds
Upper bounds

Branch and bound
- Solution and subsolutions

Prune
- by bound
- by opt
- by infeasibility

TSP:
Upper bounds: greedy
Lower bounds: onetree
Branch: degree 3 or higher vertex - edge in or not.
