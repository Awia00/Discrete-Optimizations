Relaxation

Langrangian.

sum(i=1...n)(a_ij*x_i) <= b_j for some j 
sum(i=1...n)(a_ij*x_i)-b_j <= 0
u * sum(i=1...n)(a_ij*x_i)-b_j <= 0

for feasible x: constraint is negative
for infeasible x: constraint is positive - price for going outside region.

Objective function:
sum(i=1...n)(c_i x_i) - u*(sum(i=1...n)(a_ij*x_i)-b_j) for some j.

For any x in feasible region objective is higher.
For any x outside feasible region we dont know - but if it is lower we will pick a value inside feasible region

Solve by inspection.

Dual langrange.
we want to find the langrange which modifies it such that it is the closest to the original.
Hence minimize the original objective since it is higher in any case.
