# 7. ILP - focus on column generation
ILP

Exponentially many variables.
Draw the solution space and subspace

Dual area is small for many variables. Cut off dual space until you hit a feasible solution in original opt
Dual objective and primal objective touches when optimal

Reduced cost: new c = c_i - sum(j=1...m)(dual_j * a_ij)

Idea:   cost of new i - whatever you already paid to visit the customers i visit.
        Is negative if new cost is lower than already paid cost.

Solved by a LP over arcs to get new routes.

Iteratively solve Dual LP and run pricing getting new columns

Branch and price:
    sum over arcs based on routes
    Branch on deleting non 1 sum arc or enforcing it.
