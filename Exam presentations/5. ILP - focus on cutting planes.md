# 5. ILP - focus on cutting planes
ILP
Chvatal Gomora:
    sum(i=1...n)a_ij x_i <= b_j
    Now times constant u on both sides
    Now round left side down
    Now round right side down.
    Finding value for u over all constraints np-hard
    Can sum all constraints.

    example: u = 7
    6x_1 + 7x_2 <= 18
    
Gomoro cut
    given a LP solution how to cut off the given solution

    b_i-floor(b_i) -Sum(i=1...n)((a_ij -floor(a_ij)) * x_i) <= 0

    example: 
    20/7-floor(20/7=14/7) -((1/7 - floor(1/7 =0)) x_1 + (2/7-floor(2/7 =0)) x_2)
    6/7 - (1/7x_1 + 2/7x_2) <= 0
    6/7 - 1/7x_1 - 2/7x_2 <= 0
    new constraint
    -1/7x_1 - 2/7_x2 <= -6/7
    
    Notice that the constraint makes the current solution infeasible since non-basic = 0
