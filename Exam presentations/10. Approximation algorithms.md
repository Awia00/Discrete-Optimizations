# 10. Approximation algorithms
Optimization

Upper bounds: relaxation
Lower bound: heuristic or approximation

Heuristics - no proof no garuantees.

Approximation:
    k-approximation scheme
    (1+e)-approximation scheme
    PTAS
    FPTAS

Set Cover
    Matching
        maximal vs maximum matching
    Pricing
        An edge pays a price to be in the solution.
        Each vertex can pay c_i
        Add until all edges incident to tight vertex.

Knapsack
    Round numbers by constant: lose some precision on flooring.
    O(n^2*P)
    p*_i = p_i/K
    K=e*P/n
    Polynomial in n and 1/e since: 
        highest profit = floor(P/K) = floor(P/(eP/n)) = floor(n/e)
