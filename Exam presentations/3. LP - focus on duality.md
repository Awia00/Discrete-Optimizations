# 3. LP - focus on duality

Optimization

Linear programming
Upper bounds.

Dual
- interpetation
- From primal to dual
- Weak duality: dual is upper bound.
- Strong duality: optimal 
- reading dual solution from primal
    if n+i in NONBASIC: -c_i
    if n+i in BASIC: 0

Might be easier to solve if m>>n

TODO: needs more theory.
